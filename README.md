1. I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. Because "message" feature is the major funtion of the app and I need to make sure that the fuctionality works well before implementing any additional features.
2. I wouldn't use a unit test to test the "max message length". Because it can be tested with other features. In addition, it is not a major feature.
